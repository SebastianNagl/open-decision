"The open decision project aims to create an open source platform for "

"specific questions into complex decision trees. These can be exported into "

"The platform is divided into two modules. The Builder offers a simple web "
"interface for the creation of decision trees. The counterpart is the "
"interpreter, which represents the decision trees for the end user. The "
"presentation can be done on different channels, online, via app or in chat "
"bots. The communication between the Builder and the Interpreter runs via a "
"standardized data format."

"The Builder acts as a translator of legal ideas into a uniform, machine-"
"readable data format. It is therefore essential that this process takes "
"place without friction. A simple and intuitive usability is therefore the "
"main focus during development in order to enable non-IT-savvy lawyers to "
"create content. With a simple interface, decision trees can be created "
"visually by drag & drop. After an automated quality control, the finished "
"decision trees are prepared for manual review by experts (qualified lawyers) "
"if required, in order to guarantee the highest quality standards."

"To ensure low-threshold access, we offer a simple user interface on a "
"variety of channels. Internally, we have already successfully launched a "
"website and a chat bot for the Telegram messenger service. Various chat bots "
"and our own mobile app are planned. The structure is to be cross-platform in "
"a uniform and clear scheme: The consumer first selects the appropriate "
"problem from a catalogue. The program then begins to query the facts, which "
"corresponds to the decision tree behind it. After asking as few questions as "
"possible, the user receives a compilation of information, forwarding and, if "
"necessary, sample letters on his concretely determined case."
